# Car_Price_predictor
## To predict the price of the cars for the selling , I had created a Car Price Predictor while doing Internship at YBI Foundation.
<br>
* Leveraged Machine Learning in Jupyter Notebook to ceate a Car Price Predictor.<br>
* Basic Analysis was done in MS-Excel. <br>
* Cleaning of the columns like "price" , "kms_driven" was done in Jupyter Notebook using Python.<br>
* Seaborn box plot, distplot were used for the detection of outliers and skewed data.<br>
* Created pipeline using column transformer.<br>
* Linear Regression and Decison Trees algorithms used for the making of models.
